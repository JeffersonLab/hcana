hcana - Hall C ROOT/C++ analyzer
============================================

hcana is an under-development tool to analyze data from the HMS, SHMS and
SOS spectrometers in
[Hall C](http://www.jlab.org/Hall-C/) at [JLab](http://www.jlab.org/).
It is being developed to replace
the historical Hall C analyzer, ENGINE, which was written in Fortran.
hcana will be the package used to analyze Hall C date in the 12 GeV era.
hcana is being written in C++, using the CERN ROOT framework.  hcana is
an extension to the Hall A analyzer, PODD.

NOTE: In the process of retrieving the hcana source code, a copy of
the Hall A PODD package will be downloaded.  The version of PODD included
has been slightly modified for use with hcana.  For an official version
of PODD, see the [ROOT/C++ Analyzer for Hall A](http://hallaweb.jlab.org/podd/) page.

Downloading
-----------

Instructions for downloading hcana can be found in the
[Hall C Wiki](https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/ROOT_Analyzer/Git).

Compiling
---------
hcana may be compiled with either make or scons.  Switching between these
two build systems make require some cleanup of dependency files, binary files
and other autogenerated files.

Before compiling, type
`source setup.sh` or `source setup.csh`
depending on whether your shell is bash or csh.

### Compiling with make
    make

### Compiling with scons
    python ./podd/scons/scons.py
To do the equivalent of "make clean", do
`python ./podd/scons/scons.py -c`
To compile the standalone codes the are part of podd, do
`python ./podd/scons/scons.py standalone=1`

Running
-------
Basic instructions on how to run hcana are in the
[Hall C Wiki](https://hallcweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/ROOT_Analyzer/Running).
