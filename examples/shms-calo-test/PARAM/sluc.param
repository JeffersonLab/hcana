; These come from Tang.  They were done assuming that the peak
; corresponded to 12 p.e.  The factor of 0.5 converts this to 6 p.e.
; which is a better value for the correct beta of the particles.
; The two which are 0.5/200. are ones with basically no signal,
; due to incorrect timing of the ADC signal.
