Instructions for calibration of the SHMS calorimeter.


1. Currently the code works on the Monte Carlo simulated data. The
simulated data are in plain text file, while the calibration code
needs a root file as input. To prepare a root file from a text file,
run make_root.C script in the mc_results directory.  The script takes
2 input parameters: prefix of the input file and SHMS momentum
setting. For example, the command

root [0] .x make_root.C+("5",5.)

will produce a root file named 5.root from the input text file 5.r.


2. Make Root_files directory, if not present. Copy (or link) the root
file in the mc_results directory into the Root_files under the name
Pcal_calib_<run_number>.root name. This file will serve as an input to
the calibration code.


3. Run pcal_calib.cpp Root script to calibrate a run. For instance,
the Root command

root [1] .x pcal_calib.cpp+(5)

will produce pcal.param.5 text file containing the calibration
constants, along with other text files for debug purposes. The
graphics output will show distributions of the normalized energy
depositions before and after the calibration, and deviation of
momentum versus the normalized energy deposition on a scattered plot.
