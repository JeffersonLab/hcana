Instructions for calibration the HMS calorimeter under hcana.

1. Go to hcana/hcal_calib directory.

2. Copy (or link) DBASE, MAPS and PARAM directories into the hcal_calib.

3. Create Root_files directory.

4. Copy (or link) the raw data log file of the run to be calibrated into the
   hcal_calib.

5. Under hcana, replay the run by runnning hcal_replay.C for a number of events
   (e.g. hcal_replay.cpp(52949,100000)). This will create an output Root file
   in the Root_files directory.

6. Calibrate the run by compiling and running hcal_calib.C under hcana
   (e.g. hcal_calib.C+(52949)). This will output calibration constants in a
   hcal.param.<RunNumber> file. Also, it will display Canvas with histograms of
   uncalibated and calibrated normalized energy depositions, and a scattered
   plot of momentum variation versus the normalized energy deposition.
